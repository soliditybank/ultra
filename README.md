Military-grade security for your onchain transactions.

## FROM A SECURE COMPUTER (e.g. air-gapped computer):
Step 1. git clone https://github.com/soliditybank/ultra.git

Step 2. Open the '/ultra.html' file on a browser offline.

Step 3. Generate your - truly random - private key. Other options available.

Step 4. Fill the transaction details and sign it. A QR of the signature is generated.

## IMPORTANT
Your address must be funded with enough Ether to cover the transaction fee.

## FROM ANY DEVICE (e.g. your phone):
Step 5. Go to https://soliditybank.com/ultra and scan the QR. Or copy/paste the signature.

Step 6. Execute the transaction and wait for confirmation.

## Possible Issues
Insufficient ether in your address to pay the network fee.

Transaction nonce is already used. Check the current nonce of your address before signing the transaction.
